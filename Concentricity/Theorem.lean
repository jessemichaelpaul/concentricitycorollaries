The π₀ lemma (master `lem:pi0-grothendieck`) and the statement of the
Concentricity Theorem (master `thm:concentricity`).

The statement layer STOPS here: the proof of `thm:concentricity` — the
C1–C4 assembly, including the placement sentence (landed in the master
2026-07-03, the author's alone) — is Phase 4.

`sorry` marks UNFORMALIZED, never UNSOUND (R8).

/-- RE-BADGED 2026-07-05 (PLAN_reencode_concentricity_2026-07-05.md §5):
translation-layer row — the level read that the STATIC readout consumes.
The master label `thm:concentricity` now lives on
`ASection.concentricity_transport` (Concentricity/TransportObject.lean).

The **transport level** of the n-th residue-ℂ zero-sphere: the level of
the fibre point over the n-th zero-sphere, read in the vocabulary of
`lem:exp-degenerate` (`Octonion.exp_fibre_neg_real`,
Concentricity/Toolkit.lean) — a degenerate-fibre point
φ_v(log r + (2k+1)πi) carries its level log r as its real part: "The fibre
is thus indexed by the single real level log r = log|−r| and, within it, by
the odd winding indices 2k+1 carried as band data" (master
`lem:exp-degenerate`); "GPV's log|·| is a label on objects, never an
operation" (master `def:base`).

DERIVED (R10; Brief-6 binding condition (1)): computed from the existing
`def:A-section` data alone — the C3 enumeration `sphereZero` of the
residue-ℂ zero-spheres by their upper-half-plane stem representatives —
through the Step-A cone nodes' level reading; NEVER a new structure field,
never a strengthening of `def:A-section`. The winding height (the imaginary
part, odd multiples of π under the placement) stays band data, never an
object label (master `def:base`). -/
def ASection.transportLevel (A : ASection) (n : ℕ) : ℝ :=
  (A.sphereZero n).re

/- RE-BADGED 2026-07-05 (PLAN_reencode §5), SUPERSEDED 2026-07-06 by the
author's ruling (a): the master label and the open node now live on
`ASection.concentricity` below; this record is kept as the placement
paragraph's transcription map. Original text:
the ONE open node, at its
translation-layer address — welded to `placement_set` by the proved
`placement_set_iff`; consumed by `cor:nontrivial`, never by
`concentricity_transport`. Statement and sorry unchanged.

**The placement** (master, proof of `thm:concentricity`, the placement
paragraph, verbatim): "Through the commuting triangle π∘E = exp
([Rem. 5.2(a)]{VS}), the unique tame lift traverses the logarithm manifold
as a single closed loop ([Cor. 5.13]{GPVwind}), and every point of the
degenerate fibre it meets is, by Lemma lem:exp-degenerate, the level log r
paired with an odd winding height I(2k+1)π: all multiplicity in the fibre
lies in the winding direction ([Cor. 5.21]{GPVwind}), none in the level.
Since 𝓑 is static — no morphisms between distinct levels (Definition
def:base) — the level is a conserved quantity along every zigzag of 𝒯_A,
and the degenerate fibre of the unique tame transport attached to the
A-section — the residue-ℂ zero-spheres {q_n} of C3 — lies over a *single*
level."

All four hypotheses are live in the assembly this transcribes (master,
assembly paragraph; R3): C2 supplies the outright continuation of the
hypercomplex logarithm on Ω₀ (`exists_log_continuation`); C3 the
exponential expression over the full divisor, agreeing with C2 on the
overlap by the Identity Theorem (`stem_identity`), whence the tame lift is
unique (`winding_lift_unique`); C1's pole is the cone through which the
value-loops close ([Cor. 5.13]{GPVwind}); C4 makes the degenerate fibre
infinite.

Queued (R8) — sorried against the sorried cone nodes of
Concentricity/Toolkit.lean; step-by-step transcription record:
(a) "the unique tame lift traverses the logarithm manifold as a single
closed loop" — GPVwind Cor 5.13, whose σ-apparatus is the recorded GAP of
`winding_loop_defect`; (b) "every point of the degenerate fibre it meets
is … the level log r paired with an odd winding height I(2k+1)π" —
`Octonion.exp_fibre_neg_real` (sorried); (c) the C2/C3 agreement feeding
(a) — `stem_identity` (sorried); (d) "the level is a conserved quantity
along every zigzag of 𝒯_A" — PROVED, `TotalObject.level_eq_of_zigzag`
(Concentricity/Base.lean); (e) "lies over a *single* level" — the
conclusion discharged here. -/
/-- **THE CONCENTRICITY THEOREM** (master `thm:concentricity`; the
statement carrier per the author's ruling of 2026-07-06, superseding the
2026-07-05 re-encode: "(a) is literally the entire point of this entire
project" — the theorem, stated as the author means it): **the infinitely
many residue-ℂ zero-spheres of an A-section are concentric — one real
centre.** The concentric dictionary's reading of the A-section's one
concentric component: [the concentric component] → ∃ c, one centre.

THE ONE OPEN NODE of the repository (R8: `sorry` = UNFORMALIZED, never
UNSOUND). Everything on both sides is proved and certified: the transport
connectivity (`concentricity_transport`, frozen kernel certificate), the
articulation (`concentric_articulation` — one component, defined through
the witness 𝔫, fibre concentric), the Φ-collapse and π₀(𝒮₂)
(PhiConversion.lean: the glue total and proper, the slice world's
components = the value moduli), the complete BL ladder (D0–D3 + mirror +
D2's iff `placement_set_iff_liSum` — this statement's proved kernel-
coordinate equivalent: ∃β two-sided positivity), the σ-closure rows, the
supplier chain, and the corollary chain (`cor:nontrivial`, `cor:rh` with
½ from `thm:rh-equiv`'s proved rigidity) consuming it downstream. The
transport's memory is the witness structure; the transport over the base
remembers the centres in the A-section (`rmk:collapse-cone`); this row is
the memory's readback. -/

residue-ℂ zero-spheres then arrive as the degenerate fibre of its
transport, an output; and π₀ reads off their component").

has moved to `ASection.concentricity_transport` (TransportObject.lean),
where connectivity is the section's own, through N. The static object is
the general ring 𝓡's geometry: static, connects nothing, by design.

**The former statement row** (master `thm:concentricity` v4 wording, kept):
"Let A be an A-section (Definition def:A-section). Then the residue-ℂ zero
spheres of A all lie in a single connected component of the total object

each winding index carried by the band — hence has a single image in
