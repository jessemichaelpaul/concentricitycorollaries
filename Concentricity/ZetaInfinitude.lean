Concentricity/ZetaInfinitude.lean

Route A of PROOF_PLAN_zeta_infinitude.md (approved via map thread): the
Hadamard-infinitude fact as a SORRIED THEOREM, proved in-repo — never an
axiom (author's ruling 2026-07-03, carried by HANDOFF.md; supersedes the
same-day axiom ruling). Master: `cor:hadamard-infinitude` (under
`thm:hadamard`), consumed at `cor:zeta-section`.

Gate: zero sorries + zero project axioms; this file's target sorry is
burned down lemma-by-lemma (A1–A10), one commit per lemma on green,
pin-present names only (v4.31.0 = fabf563a).

`sorry` marks UNFORMALIZED, never UNSOUND (R8).

/-- **The target** (author's ruling, verbatim statement): the Riemann zeta
function has infinitely many nontrivial zeros. The nontriviality predicate
mirrors Mathlib's `RiemannHypothesis` exclusions; the trivial-zero clause
matches `riemannZeta_neg_two_mul_nat_add_one` (RiemannZeta.lean:171)
verbatim.

Proof route (approved): Route A of PROOF_PLAN_zeta_infinitude.md — suppose
finitely many; extract the finite zero divisor of ξ
(`MeromorphicOn.extract_zeros_poles`), take a global logarithm, bound growth
via the Mellin/theta representation and the unconditional functional
equation, force the log-factor affine by Borel–Carathéodory + Cauchy
estimates, contradict Γ-growth on the real axis. Queued (R8); burned down
at A1–A10 below. -/
